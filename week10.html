      <h1>Week 10 Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Validation is a very important thing in websites. It can keep us
          organized and not confused.
        </li>
        <li>
          One of the simplest forms of validation is when entering a password
          and a comment might come up that says the criteria that is required for
          the password.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is called client-side validation and is very important for us to use
          regularly to keep users from being confused.
        </li>
        <li>Here is an example of client-side validation:</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p><form></p>
      <p><label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or cherry? (required)</label></p>
      <p><input id="choose" name="i_like" required></p>
      <p><button>Submit</button></p>
      <p></form></p>
      <hr>
      <ul>
          <li>This example uses the "required" attribute.</li>
          <li>Using this attribute will force the user to enter in something to submit.</li>
          <li>This is very helpful when a user is making a profile or logging in to their account.</li>
          <li>Being able to fetch API's is very important too.</li>
          <li>This allows us to be able to manipulate parts of the HTTP pipeline and it can also fetch resources across networks.</li>
          <li>Here is an example of the fetch attribute being used:</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <p>fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')</p>
      <p>.then(response => response.json())</p>
      <p>.then(data => console.log(data));</p>
      <hr>
      <ul>
          <li>This example above fetches a file across the network and prints it onto the console.</li>
          <li>This can help with staying organized and saving time when needing to import data.</li>
          <li>We can use things called response objects. They allow us to display status codes and see if the website is working</li>
